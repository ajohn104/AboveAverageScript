# Sublime Preferences and Syntax Highlighting

This is purely the current syntax highlighting I customized for the language in sublime.
It doesn't necessarily cover all the details it could, and I haven't updated it recently so it 
isn't up to date on all the keywords, but as time goes on it will become closer to the ideal
syntax highlighting. But for now, I'm focusing on making the planned implementation changes.


## Steps

_Now, I know not everyone knows how to go about changing sublime's syntax highlighting, and I
certainly didn't do as good of a job as I could have but I just wanted the basics done. So, here
are some steps to help you put these files where they go. I don't own a Mac, so if anyone has
corrections for the Mac version (or Linux), go ahead and do a pull request. But here's exactly how
to do it for Windows (and presumably all other OS's)._

### Step 1
Open sublime.

### Step 2
In the menu bar, go to the 'Preferences' drop down.

### Step 3
Select 'Browse Packages...'


_Ok, now you're in the section where you need to place the folder 'AboveAverageScript' found
in this directory into. Nothing too complicated._ 


### Step 4
Copy the 'AboveAverageScript' folder from _**this**_ directory into the folder that opened when you
completed Step 3.

### Step 5
I don't know if this is entirely necessary, but for completeness (and fewer issues),
completely close sublime. Not just exiting it, but fully close all open files. If you
don't feel the need, then don't. I just haven't yet confirmed that sublime will immediately
integrate the file extension identification, so it might not automatically show highlights
for .avg files. But that's it.



_And, in true internet fashion, a TL;DR_


_**TL;DR**_: Take the 'AboveAverageScript' folder in this directory and copy it into your sublime packages folder.
That folder can be found by selecting 'Browse Packages' from the 'Preferences' drop down in the menu bar.
